# [What Does Vector Mean?](https://www.couchbase.com/blog/what-is-vector-search/)
A vector is a data structure that holds an array of numbers. In our case, this refers to vectors that store a digital summary of the data set they were applied to. It can be thought of as a fingerprint or a summary but formally is called an embedding. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how one might look:

```javascript
"blue t-shirts": [-0.02511234  0.05473123 -0.01234567 ...  0.00456789  0.03345678 -0.00789012]
```
